# HABITABLE PLANET PREDICTOR

## ABOUT

Made model using `tensorflow` that can predict whether planet is habtiable or not-habitable base on provided values.
These values or parameters can be use to predict upcoming outcome.
### `PARAMETERS : `

* `MASS(EARTH)` : The mass of the planet in Earth units
* `SURFACE TEMPERATURE` : The planets surface temperture
* `ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE(bar)` : the force exerted by a planet's atmosphere
* `DISTANCE(AU)` : The distance between planet and its host star in astronomical unit
* `ORBITAL(D)` : How long does it take for planet to does full orbit around its host star

* `ECCENTRICITY` : describes the extent to which an orbit is elliptical or deviates from a perfect circle
* `WATER PRESENCE(%)` : the percentage of the planet's total mass or surface area that is composed of water
* `STELLAR FLUX(EARTH)` : the amount of solar energy (or radiation) a planet receives from its star, relative to the amount Earth receives from the Sun
